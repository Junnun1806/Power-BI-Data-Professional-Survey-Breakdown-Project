üìä Data Professional Survey: Career Insights Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyse and visualise key career metrics from a survey of data professionals. This tool provides insights into salaries, popular technologies, job satisfaction, and demographics within the data industry.

üìù Project Purpose & Description
The Data Professional Survey Dashboard is an analytical report built to help aspiring data professionals, students, and recruiters understand the current landscape of the data industry. The dashboard addresses common questions about salary expectations, work-life balance, in-demand skills, and the perceived difficulty of entering the field. By presenting the data visually, it allows users to quickly identify trends and make informed career decisions.

üíª Tech Stack
The dashboard was developed using the following tools and technologies:

üìä Power BI Desktop: Main platform used for data modelling, analysis, and report creation.

üìÇ Power Query: Used for data cleaning, transformation, and preparation of the raw survey data.

üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Implemented for creating key measures such as average age, salary, and satisfaction scores.

üé® Data Visualization: A combination of charts and KPIs were used to present the insights effectively.

üìÅ File Format: .pbix for the development file.

üíæ Data Source
The data was sourced from a public survey of data professionals, survey conducted by Alex Freberg. The dataset contains anonymised responses covering topics such as job titles, current salaries, favourite programming languages, country of work, age, and satisfaction levels.

‚ú® Features & Highlights
Business Problem
For individuals looking to enter or advance in the data industry, it can be difficult to find clear, consolidated information on key career questions. What is a realistic salary expectation for a Data Analyst versus a Data Scientist? Which programming languages are most valuable to learn? How satisfied are current professionals with their work-life balance? This dashboard was created to answer these questions using real-world survey data.

Enable users to explore salary benchmarks across different roles.

Highlight the most popular and in-demand programming languages.

Provide insights into job satisfaction and work-life balance.

Visualise the demographic and geographic distribution of data professionals.
